# Create an application to store and retrieve recipes.
# Each recipe can include a name, list of ingredients and quantities. [cooking instructions is too much text]
# 
# To add:
# Upscale recipes: standard is 4 portions, but you can also make 2 or 6 and it adjusts accordingly
# Type in ingredients  you have and with a set comparison it checks which recipes e.g. use carrots AND potatoes
# checking if recipe already exists with .setdefault()
# Use slicing and string methods for displaying and formatting recipes.
